This will be a memory game for solo play only. 
    
Basic layout will be 20 cards on a game board, 10 sets of 2 of the same cards; in a 4 column x 5 row style.


The cards will have images on both the front (specific Team) and back (generic).


Cards will be shuffled at the start of the game, and placed face down on the board.
For the purpose of having a winner and loser, a timer will start when the game begins.


The player will select 2 cards, which makes the face down cards, become face up. 


If both cards match, they will remain face up until the game is over. Player continues selection.
If both cards do not match, they will return to their face down postion. Player continues selection.
